Summary: Facebook's access controls are a classically ironic deal with the devil.

There's
[a great old tweet](https://x.com/matthew_d_green/status/525441833024110593?s=20)
from
[Matthew Green](https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social):

![Screenshot of tweet from X user @matthew_d_green, display name "Matthew Green is on BlueSky", text of: "I would liken Tor to putting on Sauron's ring. The wearer is invisible to ordinary beings, like Men, but highly visible to the Nazgûl."

I'm not a Tor expert, or even a Tor user, so I wouldn't trust my interpretation
here to match Green's intent. But the dramatic stakes are preserved if I go
with something like, "Tor saves you the risk that normies are snooping on your
network activity secrets, but incurs the new risk that your shadowy,
sophisticated
[exit node operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing#Exit_node_vulnerability)
can compromise it instead."

I think about the tweet a lot because I made a similar trade when my first kid
was born:

1.  We wanted a way to share baby pictures,
2.  with extended family,
3.  without just posting the pictures for the whole world to see,
4.  so we set up a private group on Facebook.

On Facebook! We wanted to preserve our privacy, so we turned to Facebook.
[This Facebook.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_Facebook)

And it's worked, as far as I can tell. It was *very* easy to get my extended
family set up see baby photos: they all had Facebook accounts. And normie
snoops can't pull up photos of my kids, the way you can pull up 
[photos of me]({static}images/0002_bgawalt_image_search.png).

Anything I built myself for this purpose would have been worse on both counts.
I wouldn't have been able to get my grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc., all
a way to prove their identity to my hand-rolled access control system. And I
would be much more likely to have screwed something up in the hobby-level-effort
implementation vs. Facebook's professional engineering, rendering it all
normie-snoopable.

But the *as far as I can tell* part, that part two paragraphs ago, is the
Nazghûl part. I am not sharing my baby photos with you, the normie reading this
blog. But I am sharing them *with Facebook.*

I doubt they're doing anything *too*-too diabolical with them. Probably they've
pieced together how many kids I have, of what basic ages and genders, to show
me the right ads. Less likely, but more much offensive to me: maybe they've set
up
[shadow profiles](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy)
for the kids themselves, so that they can someday show *them* the right ads.

I am just left stewing in the irony, wishing there were an obvious and easy way
for a comfortable-building-a-website guy like me to not rely on Facebook for
access control lists.
