<a href="https://x.com/matthew_d_green/status/525441833024110593?s=20">a great old tweet</a>
from
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social">Matthew Green</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of tweet from X user @matthew_d_green, display name &quot;Matthew Green is on BlueSky&quot;, text of: &quot;I would liken Tor to putting on Sauron's ring. The wearer is invisible to ordinary beings, like Men, but highly visible to the Nazgûl.&quot; Posted 5:21 PM, Oct 23, 2014; 922 likes, 828 retweets, as of this blog post" src="/images/0002_tor_nazghul_tweet.png"></p>
<p>I'm not a Tor expert, or even a Tor user, so I wouldn't trust my interpretation
here to match Green's intent. But the dramatic stakes are preserved if I go
with something like, "Tor saves you the risk that normies are snooping on your
network activity secrets, but incurs the new risk that your shadowy,
sophisticated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing#Exit_node_vulnerability">exit node operator</a>
can compromise it instead."</p>
<p>I think about the tweet a lot because I made a similar trade when my first kid
was born:</p>
<ol>
<li>We wanted a way to share baby pictures,</li>
<li>with extended family,</li>
<li>without just posting the pictures for the whole world to see,</li>
<li>so we set up a private group on Facebook.</li>
</ol>
<p>On Facebook! We wanted to preserve our privacy, so we turned to Facebook.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_Facebook">This Facebook.</a></p>
<p>And it's worked, as far as I can tell. It was <em>very</em> easy to get my extended
family set up see baby photos: they all had Facebook accounts. And normie
snoops can't pull up photos of my kids, the way you can pull up 
<a href="/images/0002_bgawalt_image_search.png">photos of me</a>.</p>
<p>Anything I built myself for this purpose would have been worse on both counts.
I wouldn't have been able to get my grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc., all
a way to prove their identity to my hand-rolled access control system. And I
would be much more likely to have screwed something up in the hobby-level-effort
implementation vs. Facebook's professional engineering, rendering it all
normie-snoopable.</p>
<p>But the <em>as far as I can tell</em> part, that part two paragraphs ago, is the
Nazghûl part. I am not sharing my baby photos with you, the normie reading this
blog. But I am sharing them <em>with Facebook.</em></p>
<p>I doubt they're doing anything <em>too</em>-too diabolical with them. Probably they've
pieced together how many kids I have, of what basic ages and genders, to show
me the right ads. Less likely, but more much offensive to me: maybe they've set
up
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy">shadow profiles</a>
for the kids themselves, so that they can someday show <em>them</em> the right ads.</p>
<p>I am just left stewing in the irony, wishing there were an obvious and easy way
for a comfortable-building-a-website guy like me to not rely on Facebook for
access control lists.</p>                </article>
