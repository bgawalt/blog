[Lol Coxhill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lol_Coxhill), by way of
[RJD2's "Salud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadringer_(album)):

> Okay, this is the first record I've made under my own name.
> And the first one I've made under my own control entirely
> without anyone else telling me what to do in certain places.
>
> Some of the stuff I like very much, some of the stuff I quite like.
> And I don't hate any of it, so I've settled for this music.
> I can't decide which piece to start with, so I won't start with any of the
> pieces; I've already started.
>
> I hope you like what you hear.
