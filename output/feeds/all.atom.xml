&lt;p&gt;Here's an opportunity to talk about the tech industry narrowly (there's hype
about humanoid robots) and broadly (there's eternal investor demand for
platforms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Palko has been hard at work this month, laying out what's so frustrating
about humanoid robots. You should read 'em all, but for the purposes of this
post, here are some key quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2,
    &lt;a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2025/05/the-cylon-tos-design-fallacy.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cylon Design Fallacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
    "The Cylon design fallacy is that robots should be designed to interface
    with systems that were designed to interact with humans and systems designed
    to work with robots should interface with them in the same ways they would
    interact with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[...W]hy pick a design that is far more expensive and
less efficient just so it can use tools that only look the way they do
because they were designed for humans to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[...]As for the argument
that the same robot could go from working in a factory to cleaning your
house, why would we want it to? You’ll be paying for functionality you don’t
need and compromising on functionality that you do. And even if you insist
on a one-size-fits-all model, what reason—other than the naivest of naive
biomimicry—is there to believe that the sci-fi movie robot is the design
you’d want to go with?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 5,
    &lt;a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2025/05/surprisingly-despite-elon-musks.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surprisingly, despite Elon Musk's involvement, this may turn out to be a scam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
    "When the dust settles, hundreds of billions of dollars will have been
    wasted on an embarrassing techno-optimist hash of bad engineering, flawed
    economic reasoning, and hackneyed sci-fi tropes." Plus a big old roundup of
    tweets, just tomahawk dunking on the humanoid design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 6,
    &lt;a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2025/05/a-few-years-ago-morgan-stanley-released.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few years ago Morgan Stanley released an analysis promising that the metaverse would soon be worth more than $5 trillion dollars. Their latest one on humanoid robots may not rise to that level of prescience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
    "There's no reason a robot with 5-fingered hands with opposable thumbs needs
    to be otherwise humanoid. Being bipedal is arguably the main driver of cost
    and complexity but it barely figures it all in the only reasons they give
    for going with the humanoid design."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 15 and May 21,&lt;/strong&gt; [delayed till below for reasons of poetic license]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above is good and correct; read the posts and you will better
understand the technology and the business of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'd like to explicitly introduce a term that doesn't appear in the 
above posts: platform. The hypothetical non-ignorant investor in humanoid robots
will need a substantial dose of motivated reasoning to overcome/overlook the
above. And with the word "platform" I can provide that hypothetical motivation.
A successful platform is wildly lucrative, and investors have a long history of
both (a) backing them even despite daunting realities of engineering and
arithmetic, and (b) backing them for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Ball published the longform explainer for platform investing in May
2023,
&lt;a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/bigtechbiggestbets"&gt;"Big Tech’s Biggest Bets (Or What It Takes to Build a Billion-User Platform)"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I]t’s notable that almost all of the most valuable companies in the world
operate digital platforms that support billions of daily users and tens of
billions of dollars in economic value daily. iOS is owned by the world’s most
valuable company, Apple, while Android is owned by the number-three entrant,
Google. Google also operates Google Search and Chrome, the top two platforms
of the World Wide Web. The second-most-valuable company, Microsoft, owns
Windows, the third-most-used operating system, as well as Azure, the
second-most-used cloud infrastructure provider. The world’s fourth-largest
company, Amazon, has a distant fourth-place OS, Fire, which runs on its
tablets, TVs, and digital assistants (500MM+ total sold), but also the
leading cloud service platform (AWS). Though not a strictly digital platform,
it’s worth highlighting that three-quarters of Amazon’s e-commerce sales are
through its third-party marketplace—an infrastructure platform[....]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...I]t is the ecosystem that makes a platform so powerful. Not only does the
ecosystem generate “rents” and provide extra value to users, it produces
powerful barriers to market entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific platform everyone's chasing is that big one up front, iOS
(chart from Ball):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bar chart of Apple annual operating cash flow" src="images/0003_apple_cash_flow.png" style="width=80%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball details how much money companies pour into would-be platforms, with Google
Cloud (my most recent employer) as one example (emphasis Ball's):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2008 also saw Google launch Google Cloud, which the company viewed as both a
strategic necessity and a lucrative commercial opportunity. Since then, net
losses have hit nearly $35B. During this same time, AWS generated nearly three
times as much in profit. In fact, 2022 was the first year Google Cloud’s
&lt;strong&gt;topline&lt;/strong&gt; exceeded AWS’s &lt;strong&gt;bottomline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Meta’s Reality Labs and Amazon’s Alexa investments, there is
clear evidence of Google Cloud’s improving prospects. Annual losses have
halved from their peak of $5.6B on $13B in revenue in 2020 (−43%) to $2.9B in
2022 (−11%), and in Q1 2023, the division booked its first profit, $191MM on
7.5B, or 2.6% margins. Most analysts expect the division to remain in the
black going forward. Still, forecasts suggest Google Cloud won’t reach
cumulative breakeven until the 2030s (it won’t be IRR positive until years
later,). That’s a literal quarter century and not guaranteed, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bar charts of Apple annual operating cash flow" src="images/0003_google_cloud.png" style="width=80%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason to hype humanoid robots, bipedalism and all, is to appeal to this
platform play and imply these platform profits, so long as investors recognize
that the precedent for platforms is "give us lots of money and don't ask for it
back for a very long time." And investors go along with that, often!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often, this is a mistake -- Uber and Lyft were platform plays, and neither
turned into the next iOS -- but there's just enough success stories that the
motivated reasoning lives eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily and predictably, Palko does detect this general-purpose-platform angle,
and includes it in the fourth of five posts in the series (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 15,
    &lt;a href="http://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2025/05/more-on-humanoid-robots-who-ya-gonna.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More on humanoid robots -- who ya gonna believe?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
    "Robotics is the future but in the foreseeable future, it's not going to be
    the kind of &lt;strong&gt;bipedal humanoid Swiss Army knife&lt;/strong&gt; Tesla is supposed about to
    unveil. If there's a major breakthrough it could speed things up, but even
    under the best case scenario, serious people working in the field &lt;em&gt;[who
    Palko includes by linking to
    &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1250811320"&gt;this NPR segment&lt;/a&gt; --BG]&lt;/em&gt; will
    tell you we're years, possibly decades away[.]"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both "bipedal" and "Swiss Army knife" are load-bearing parts of the hype-promise
pitch. "Bipedal" (and the humanoid form factor generally) means avoiding what
the Morgan Stanley report called "significant modifications to the workplace to
accommodate" (link in Palko's May 6 post). The "Swiss Army knife" is the claim
that they can use all the nice, pre-existing tools, and so they will be able to
actually do work once they walk where they're meant to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And "decades away" -- that's still within, e.g., the Google Cloud time horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All together, this is supposed to add up to a large base of humanoid robot
customers, standardizing on the first mass-produced Bipedal Swiss Army Knife,
in a positive feedback loop. Adoption costs will be low, and not just because
the workplace already accommodates them. It will be easy to find the developers
and mechanics needed to retool, retrain, and repair the humanoid robots, because
the whole point of the platform is to grow a rich ecosystem around them.
Just like it's straightforward to find iOS developers, compared to
dead-ecosystem COBOL. That's the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the first direct conflict, in Palko's fifth of five posts
(emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 21,
   &lt;a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2025/05/a-few-years-ago-morgan-stanley-released.html"&gt;Humanoid robots are the blockchain of 2025&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
   "It has become embarrassingly commonplace to equate multipurpose robots with
   humanoids, despite the fact that there is &lt;strong&gt;absolutely no good reason— from an
   engineering or economic standpoint— to do so.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, it's just the
   opposite. [...F]or a given task, purpose built will always be better and
   cheaper."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android and iOS have seen their platforms expand into the point-of-sale space.
These touchscreen interfaces don't, I think, provide a good engineering reason
to move into point-of-sale. They're so much flakier and laggier to use than
good old purpose-built buttons. But there's a good economic reason:
Androids/iOSes are everywhere. You can buy a new one overnight; you can find
a contractor to retool them overnight, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype-promise is that humanoid robots will be like that, too. Worse than
purpose-built, but good enough to be everywhere, so a nice, rich ecosystem of
support to draw on to make it a cheaper/easier proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to believe this hype-promise that a line of humanoid robots will
ever be good enough to nucleate this kind of lucrative platform ecosystem.
Plenty of promised platforms never actually spin up the way they implied they
would, after burning billions of dollars trying. And you certainly shouldn't
believe that Musk's Tesla is going to be the platform epicenter in the next
few years. But it's still good to recognize the motivated reasoning at work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tech"></category><category term="tech"></category><category term="tech_industry"></category><category term="platforms"></category></entry><entry><title>Facebook Nazgûl</title><link href="https://brian.gawalt.com/blog/facebook-nazgul.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-05-10T21:50:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-05-10T21:50:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Brian Gawalt</name></author><id>tag:brian.gawalt.com,2025-05-10:/blog/facebook-nazgul.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Facebook's access controls are a classically ironic deal with the devil.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's
&lt;a href="https://x.com/matthew_d_green/status/525441833024110593?s=20"&gt;a great old tweet&lt;/a&gt;
from
&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social"&gt;Matthew Green&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of tweet from X user @matthew_d_green, display name &amp;quot;Matthew Green is on BlueSky&amp;quot;, text of: &amp;quot;I would liken Tor to putting on Sauron's ring. The wearer is invisible to ordinary beings, like Men, but highly visible to the Nazgûl.&amp;quot; Posted 5:21 PM, Oct 23, 2014; 922 likes, 828 retweets, as of this blog post" src="images/0002_tor_nazghul_tweet.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a Tor expert, or even a Tor user, so I wouldn't trust my interpretation
here to match Green's intent. But the dramatic stakes are preserved if I go
with something like, "Tor saves you the risk that normies are snooping on your
network activity secrets, but incurs the new risk that your shadowy,
sophisticated
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing#Exit_node_vulnerability"&gt;exit node operator&lt;/a&gt;
can compromise it instead."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about the tweet a lot because I made a similar trade when my first kid
was born:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We wanted a way to share baby pictures,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with extended family,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;without just posting the pictures for the whole world to see,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so we set up a private group on Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Facebook! We wanted to preserve our privacy, so we turned to Facebook.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_Facebook"&gt;This Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's worked, as far as I can tell. It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy to get my extended
family set up see baby photos: they all had Facebook accounts. And normie
snoops can't pull up photos of my kids, the way you can pull up 
&lt;a href="https://brian.gawalt.com/blog/images/0002_bgawalt_image_search.png"&gt;photos of me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything I built myself for this purpose would have been worse on both counts.
I wouldn't have been able to get my grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc., all
a way to prove their identity to my hand-rolled access control system. And I
would be much more likely to have screwed something up in the hobby-level-effort
implementation vs. Facebook's professional engineering, rendering it all
normie-snoopable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;as far as I can tell&lt;/em&gt; part, that part two paragraphs ago, is the
Nazghûl part. I am not sharing my baby photos with you, the normie reading this
blog. But I am sharing them &lt;em&gt;with Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt they're doing anything &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt;-too diabolical with them. Probably they've
pieced together how many kids I have, of what basic ages and genders, to show
me the right ads. Less likely, but more much offensive to me: maybe they've set
up
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy"&gt;shadow profiles&lt;/a&gt;
for the kids themselves, so that they can someday show &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; the right ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just left stewing in the irony, wishing there were an obvious and easy way
for a comfortable-building-a-website guy like me to not rely on Facebook for
access control lists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posting"></category><category term="posting"></category><category term="tech"></category><category term="platforms"></category></entry><entry><title>Brian Gawalt's Blog</title><link href="https://brian.gawalt.com/blog/brian-gawalts-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-05-08T13:30:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-05-08T13:30:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Brian Gawalt</name></author><id>tag:brian.gawalt.com,2025-05-08:/blog/brian-gawalts-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Brian Gawalt's blog now has its first entry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lol_Coxhill"&gt;Lol Coxhill&lt;/a&gt;, by way of

&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is the first record I've made under my own name.
And the first one I've made under my own control entirely
without anyone else telling me what to do in certain places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the stuff I like very much, some of the stuff I quite like.
And I don't hate any of it, so I've settled for this music.
I can't decide which piece to start with, so I won't start with any of the
