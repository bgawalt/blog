# Brian Gawalt's Blog (Pelican Edition)

## Dependencies

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install "pelican[markdown]"
$ python3 -m pip install pelican-render-math
```

## Workflow

Update `content` with a new Markdown post.

Test locally with

```shell
$ source ~/venv/pelican/bin/activate
$ cd ~/blog/
$ pelican --autoreload --listen
```

For ease of my own copy-pasting:

```shell
source ~/venv/pelican/bin/activate; \
cd ~/blog/; \
pelican --autoreload --listen
```

and then browse http://localhost:8000 to check it out.

Finally, create the final edition with:

```shell
$ pelican content -s publishconf.py
$ rsync -avc --delete output/ ../brian_gawalt_com/blog/
```

Then do the Git shuffle to deploy to the actual web server.

## Initial install

I am gonna try blogging by way of Pelican.

Commands executed so far:

The virtual environment for Pelican itself: 

```shell
$ python3 -m venv ~/venv/pelican
```

This uses Python 3.10.6.

When that venv was active, I installed Pelican via:

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install "pelican[markdown]"
Collecting pelican[markdown]
  Downloading pelican-4.8.0-py3-none-any.whl (1.4 MB)
[...]
```

Then I created and navigated to this directory (`~/blog`) and ran the
quickstart:

```shell
$ pelican-quickstart
Welcome to pelican-quickstart v4.8.0.

## Official instructions

```
Viewing the generated files
The files generated by Pelican are static files, so you don’t actually need
anything special to view them. You can use your browser to open the generated
HTML files directly:

$ firefox output/index.html

Because the above method may have trouble locating your CSS and other linked
assets, running Pelican’s simple built-in web server will often provide a more
reliable previewing experience:

$ pelican --listen

Once the web server has been started, you can preview your site at:
http://localhost:8000/

Deployment
After you have generated your site, previewed it in your local development
environment, and are ready to deploy it to production, you might first
re-generate your site with any production-specific settings (e.g., analytics
feeds, etc.) that you may have defined:

$ pelican content -s publishconf.py

To base your publish configuration on top of your pelicanconf.py, you can import
your pelicanconf settings by including the following line in your
publishconf.py:

from pelicanconf import *
If you have generated a publishconf.py using pelican-quickstart, this line is
included by default.

The steps for deploying your site will depend on where it will be hosted. If you
have SSH access to a server running Nginx or Apache, you might use the rsync
tool to transmit your site files:

$ rsync -avc --delete output/ host.example.com:/var/www/your-site/

There are many other deployment options, some of which can be configured when
first setting up your site via the pelican-quickstart command. See the Tips page
for detail on publishing via GitHub Pages.
